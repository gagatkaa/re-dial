# Re-Dial

**Re-Dial** is a final project for the **INT2 course at Devine University**.  
This project explores how an **old rotary landline phone** can be transformed into a **calming tool** - helping people slow down, disconnect, and take a mindful moment for themselves.

## 🌀 Concept

The act of **dialing a number** becomes a **soothing ritual**.  
Instead of making a call, each turn of the rotary phone invites the user to pause, breathe, and reflect - turning a forgotten piece of technology into a simple mindfulness experience.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **PHP** - basic logic and routing  
- **HTML** - structure and content  
- **CSS** - styling and layout  
- **No frameworks** - built fully from scratch for simplicity and control
